# header-docblock-generator
# Why?
Have you ever wondered who made a file? What does the file do? When it was made? Who owns it and what its licence is? Today we normally just check the Github README.md to find out. It wasn't so long ago that most files had all of these details just at the top of the file. A greeting in the form of documentation. It told us everything we needed to know about this file without having to go deep into the code. 

If you've ever looked back at the code of old legacy systems, especially anything in ASM. You'll see that almost all of them had these header Docblocks that told us everything about the code itself and the details to contact whoever made this
